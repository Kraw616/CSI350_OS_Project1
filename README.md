## Execution Instructions
1. Download the source code
2. Execute `main.cpp` in your favorite C++ compiler, for example, in terminal: `g++ main.cpp processes.h` in the directory containing all the source files.
3. I had to test this in an online C++ compiler (because XCode is not playing nice), so you can use something like [this](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) online C++ compiler.
