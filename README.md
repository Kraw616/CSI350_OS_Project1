## Execution Instructions
1. Download the source code
2. Compile the files in your favorite C++ compiler, for example, in terminal: `g++ main.cpp fifo_and_srt.cpp scheduling_fifo.cpp scheduling_srt.cpp setup.cpp` in the directory containing all the source files. Make sure that all 7 files are present (including the 2 headers!!). You will get a bunch of warnings, which is normal; pay no mind to them (as long as they aren't errors)!
3. In the same terminal/command window, type `./a.out` or just run the executable file.
4. If you have trouble compiling/running the program, I would recommend using an online C++ compiler such as [this](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler). Just make sure to create 7 files on there and copy and paste from the originals.
5. Done!
